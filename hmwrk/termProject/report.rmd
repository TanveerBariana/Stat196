In this R markdown file i will go through a data science interveiw question for the prestigieous wikimedia foundation

Before we get started with the questions we must set up the data sets. first we load in teh data then make sure the libraries we need are active
```{r}
wiki_data_raw <- read.csv(file = 'C:\\Users\\tanve\\Desktop\\dataSci\\stat196\\hmwrk\\termProject\\WikiData.csv')
library('data.table')
library('ggplot2')
wiki_data_raw <- data.table(wiki_data_raw)
```

Now that initial setup is done we can move onto the questions

1. What is our daily overall clickthrough rate? How does it vary between the groups?
2. Which results do people tend to try first? How does it change day-to-day?
3. What is our daily overall zero results rate? How does it vary between the groups?
4. Let session length be approximately the time between the first event and the last event in a session. Choose a variable from the dataset and describe its relationship to session length. Visualize the relationship.

The code for the initial code is as follows:
this initial line sets up the data base so that it is only filled with the important row where it recorded soemone going to a search page or clicking on a result 
```{r}
wiki_data_dates <- wiki_data_raw[which(wiki_data_raw$action == 'visitPage' | wiki_data_raw$action == 'searchResultPage'),]
```
the following code clips teh time stamp precission down to just the date, this is allows us to group the information based on date
```{r}
#cut out the section of the time stamp for hour, minute, or seconds so that you can get the dates. then make it a factor
wiki_data_dates$timestamp <- as.integer(wiki_data_dates$timestamp / 1000000)
wiki_data_dates$timestamp <- as.factor(wiki_data_dates$timestamp)
```
now we get all the different days andsave them for later 
```{r}
dates <- (unique(wiki_data_dates$timestamp))
```
then you 
```{r}
#for each date fill a data table withs its number of clicks and searches based on groups
daily <- NULL
for (i in 1:length(dates)) {
    daily$Aclicks[i] <- length(which(wiki_data_dates$action == 'visitPage' & wiki_data_dates$timestamp == dates[i] & wiki_data_dates$group == 'a'))
    daily$Asearchs[i] <- length(which(wiki_data_dates$action == 'searchResultPage' & wiki_data_dates$timestamp == dates[i] & wiki_data_dates$group == 'a'))
    daily$Bclicks[i] <- length(which(wiki_data_dates$action == 'visitPage' & wiki_data_dates$timestamp == dates[i] & wiki_data_dates$group == 'b'))
    daily$Bsearchs[i] <- length(which(wiki_data_dates$action == 'searchResultPage' & wiki_data_dates$timestamp == dates[i] & wiki_data_dates$group == 'b'))
}
#use the data gathered above to get the averages below 
daily$Aavg <- daily$Aclicks / daily$Asearchs
daily$Bavg <- daily$Bclicks / daily$Bsearchs
daily$avg <- (daily$Aclicks + daily$Bclicks) / (daily$Asearchs + daily$Bsearchs)
daily <- data.frame(daily)
daily$date <- dates
#make the row names the dates for ease of understanding
rownames(daily) <- as.character(dates)
View(daily)
#graph teh findings 
clickthrough <- ggplot(data = daily, aes(x = daily$date, y = daily$avg))
clickthrough <- clickthrough + geom_bar(aes(fill = daily$date), stat = 'identity', color = 'white', alpha = 0.4)
clickthrough <- clickthrough + ggtitle('Over all daily Avg for each date') + theme_classic() + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuRd")
clickthrough
clickthroughA <- ggplot(data = daily, aes(x = daily$date, y = daily$Aavg))
clickthroughA <- clickthroughA + geom_bar(aes(fill = daily$date), stat = 'identity', color = 'white', alpha = 0.4)
clickthroughA <- clickthroughA + ggtitle('Daily Avg for group A on each date') + theme_classic() + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuRd")
clickthroughA
clickthroughB <- ggplot(data = daily, aes(x = daily$date, y = daily$Bavg))
clickthroughB <- clickthroughB + geom_bar(aes(fill = daily$date), stat = 'identity', color = 'white', alpha = 0.4)
clickthroughB <- clickthroughB + ggtitle('Daily Avg for group B on each date') + theme_classic() + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuRd")
clickthroughB

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **R Tools | Publish | Preview** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
